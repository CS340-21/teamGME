# Proposal for a horror escape game

Parker Sherrill, Austin Maryanski, Emmanuel Chavez, Jacob Moore, Richard Swan

## I. Introduction

Our project is a Horror Escape game designed specifically for the desktop which could possibly turn into a web browser game as well. The idea is that the player starts in a room and then must use the resources around them to find a way into the next level while facing different challenges along the way.

This first-person shooter style game allows the player to roam within the different rooms, interact with objects, collect things into their inventory, and place things in order to solve the puzzle for each room and move to another level. Each room will pose a new challenge, but the continuity between each room is important so keeping to the theme will be necessary. Obviously, this style of game has done before as escape games can be quite popular, but we chose this because there are so many features we can get creative with. Adding our own twist will be important, so we hope that our individual influences can be added to the game.

None of us have ever used Unity 3D, so this is a new concept for all of us which is exciting because we can learn together and create something new for each of us. Because Unity is not free to work in teams, there is a disconnect between GitHub and Unity so that will be a challenge we must tackle.

Overall, we wanted to find a new concept and learn how to create something completely different than what we have done in the past which is why we chose to create this Horror Escape game in Unity.

## II. Customer Value

Our project will be targeting gamers as the main audience. People look to games primarily as a source of entertainment because they can be challenging and allow players to use their imaginations and creativity. The underlying problem would be to design something that could pose a challenge or be an interesting experience. Our project is a first-person horror game, and these are not uncommon however, it will be free and easy to hop straight into. The audience for horror games choose them because of the dark environments and plenty of thrills and scares. We hope that our game will stand out among others in the field because of the world we build and by providing an immersive and engaging horror experience.

We plan to create a game full of interesting environments, puzzles, and enemies. We also hope that the game will be easy to play whenever, without a large time commitment and be re-playable. Measures of success include players' enjoyment, immersion into the game world and ease of use. We could gather feedback through logging time played and customer feedback surveys.

## III. Technology

Our software will allow the user to control a character through a dungeon, while simultaneously having to solve puzzles and kill enemies to survive. There will possibly be different characters to pick from with different skills and proficiencies. The main components of the game will be all the objects that the player will interact with such as the world, puzzles and enemies. We will have to animate the objects/enemies and make sure that they are running smoothly without making the game too laggy. The minimal system would be to create the enemies first so it could be a survival game at the base, and then create the puzzles/challenges to increase the difficulty of the game. The possible enhancements would be to make the graphics/animations better and to add difficulty settings for players who want more of a challenge. The testing of the game will most likely be by us and friends who want to test it without pre-existing knowledge of how the game works. The tools we will use will all be from unity as it has many pre-built objects and functions to make pretty much any kind of game that you would want.

## IV. Team

This is almost everyone's first experience with Unity and C# on our Team. Although that is the case, there is a plethora of resources that have already helped us understand the foundations of the development platform. We will continuosly be developing the game as a whole, but each member will be responsible for specific attributes in order to perfect the visuals and functionality of our game.

- Parker Sherrill: Project lead
- Austin Maryanski: Textures/atmosphere/visuals
- Jacob Moore: Level design
- Emanuel Chavez: Game logic
- Richard Swan: Project Manager

## V. Project Management

Our desktop game will mantain a set schedule of development in order to provide the user with a fully functional, immersing horror game experience at the end of the semester. We will meet every Tuesday over zoom to gauge development, review bugs, and reconnect on necessary future steps. Below is the schedule we plan to follow in order to establish our finished FPS desktop game.

## Constraints

Our biggest constrant thus far is finding the best way to collaboratively work on our project through unity. Merging branches through Github tends to lead to conflicts with the master branch. With that being said, right now our only option is to fetch and push individually so we do not overwrite each other's code. Hopefully, we will be able to combat this problem and find a solution soon

## Resources

YouTube is our best friend throughout this experience given the lack of knowledge in Unity and C#. There is a full series that we plan to follow that will guide us through the core essentials in a horror fps game. We plan to add our own twist of course.

## Descoping

If we cannot finish the full functionality of the game, it will still be an enormous learning process for every single one of us. Understanding and utlizing collaborative workspaces like github is essential within our field. Also, learning game development is something that is not tradiotionally taught within computer science programs and will be a nice skill to add to our repetoire. Altogether, even if we cannot complete our game, we still should be able to provide an immersing horror game experience for the user that can continue to be built upon after the semester.
